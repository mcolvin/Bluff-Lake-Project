Bluff Lake is a 1,200-acre shallow lake on the Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee 
National Wildlife Refuge. Currently the lake undergoes seasonal 
drawdowns to provide cultivated moist soil plants for migrating duck 
forage and to increase concentrations of fish in shallow water habitats 
for piscivorous wading birds. Based on the work done by Chelsea 
Gilliland, refuge managers can also use these drawdowns to influence 
paddlefish populations located below Bluff Lakeâ€™s water control 
structure on Oktoc Creek (2018). However, due to lack of current or 
historical fisheries data, it is unknown how these management practices 
impact the fish assemblage, fishery, and water quality of Bluff Lake. 
Comprehensive assessments of how the drawdown impacts the fishery, fish 
assemblage, and water quality need to be completed in order to ensure 
that best management practices are being followed.
