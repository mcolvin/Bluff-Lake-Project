## Fish on Bluff Lake are sporting new accessories!!!
Thanks to graduate student Victoria Starnes and her technicians, the crappie and bass of Bluff Lake could now be sporting some new bling! Starting in June of 2019 any crappie or bass above a certain size will receive a gray floy tag. This is simply a small plastic tag with a 5-digit number that helps students keep track of a few individual fish. If you are fishing and you happen to catch one of these fish, feel free to harvest it! However, please return the tag to the visitorâ€™s center, or one of the three red PVC tag return stations soon to be posted at the Bluff Lake Boardwalk, Cypress Boardwalk, or at the Bluff Lake Boat Ramp.
