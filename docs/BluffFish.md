## The problem

Bluff Lake is a 1,200-acre shallow lake on the Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife
Refuge. The refuge was established June 14, 1940 under the Migratory Bird Conservation Act and remains an important wintering habitat for various migratory waterfowl including wood ducks and wood stork. Currently the lake undergoes seasonal drawdowns to encourage the growth of moist soil plants which provide food cover for overwintering and breeding ducks. The drawdowns also increase concentrations of fish in shallow water habitats for piscivorous wading birds. Additionally, Refuge managers have begun to use these drawdowns to influence paddlefish populations located below Bluff Lakeâ€™s water control structure. Due to lack of current or historical fisheries data, however, it is unknown how these management practices impact the fish and fishery of Bluff Lake. Comprehensive assessments on how these drastic changes in water volume effect the assemblage, abundance, condition, and demographics of common sportfish species as well as how these drawdowns effect angler effort and catch are needed to ensure that best management practices are being followed.
