You can upload the entire mosaic folder (SonarTRX-R00001-20190211-091600) to the web,
and share the doc_web.kml without having to distribute all the mosaic images.

You have not yet defined a URL for your mosaic folders, so you would need to manually
replace the 'URLTOKEN' with a valid url. For future use, press F2 in SonarTRX to define a valid URL,
so you can avoid this step.

1. Open doc_web.kml.txt with Notepad or other text editor.
2. Replace all occurences of the string: 'URLTOKEN' with the URL of your web servers parent mosaic folder.
   Example: Replace 'URLTOKEN' with 'http://www.yourdomain.com/SideScanSamples'
3. Use FTP program to upload the mosaic folder to: http://www.yourdomain.com/SideScanSamples
4. Rename the doc_web.kml.txt to doc_web.kml (since it should now have valid URL's to the images)

You should now be able to share the above kml file without having to distribute all the mosaic images.
