This is a readme file for the NavTrackProfile.csv file.

The following formula for the Elevation field was used:
Elevation = (GPSElevation + ElevationCorrection) - TransducerDepth - TransducerAltitude

PARAMETERS USED TO GENERATE THIS FILE:

ElevationCorrection                 : 0 m
TransducerDepth (below surface)     : 0 m
Sampling interval                   : 2 seconds.
Elevation or depth units in file    : m
Altitude source                     : SensorAltitude
Coordinate system                   : Geodetic (WGS84)
