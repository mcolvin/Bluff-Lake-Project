Flow data is taken from USGS gage at Macon. 

The flow is area adjusted to Bluff Lake by taking ratio between presumed watershed area above Bluff Lake (220 mi^2) and watershed area at Macon gage (768 m^2). Watershed area feeding into Bluff Lake may be incorrect based on current knowledge (as of 4/26/2019) of stream network above Bluff Lake. 

Wet, dry, and average years were determined by looking at annual mean flow across 79 years of record at the Macon USGS gage.
