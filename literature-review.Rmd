drawdown on benthos abundance in Lake Francis Case. Transactions of the 
American Fisheries Society. 

A short study describing the change in benthic invertebrate community of
a Missouri River Reservoir. They found that benthic insect abundance 
increased 3 fold after the drawdown was reduced, especially in May for 
burrowing forms of chironomids, mayflies, oligocheaches, and gnats.

Lake, Manitoba. Canadian Journal of Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences

The study evaluated the effect of winter drawdown of a lake in Manitoba. 
The drawdown lead to winterkills and limited access to shoreline 
spawning. Whitefish and ciscos were especially sensitive to winterkill. 
The study was prompted by water level management (hydroelectric regime) 
effects on reduced commercial fishery catch.

Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 98:293-304. 

This was one of the first manuscripts devoted to the subject of the 
effect of **midsummer (mid july)** reservoir drawdowns on fish 
populations. The authors used a drawdown to restructure lmb population 
in Little Dixie Lake, MO. Specifically they wanted to reduce the 
population and increase growth rates. The surface area and volume was 
reduced bh 42 and 58% retrospectively which caused the lake to become 
homothermous. They used stomach analysis to evaluate feeding activity. 
Food found in stomach increased post drawdown and the percent empty 
stomachs decreased. Growth, inferred from annual of scales was found to 
increase post drawdown. Harvest of bluegills increased immediately after 
drawdown and then declined which lmb harvest reduced but increased in 
numbers and size 2 months later. The authors speculate that with 
drawdown the small sunfish were stranded in in weedbeds and shallow 
pools and concentration of biomass lead to increased predation by bass. 

It is unclear how the system responded as the system became inundated again. 

Notes:
* Reservoir aging and declining fish production, bass are susceptible to 
egg predation as the community shifts
* Suggestion to allow fish to and insects to reach production by maintaining a 
full lake during the summer growing season and then lower the lake to concentrate
fish, thereby letting predators feed on the prey fish and knock them back. **Therefore
should know something about growth and gape size to figure out optimal drawdown**
Refilling allows the residual population to expand.
* Bass and predators harvest should decrease post drawdown because they are satiated
by concentrated forage fish

impacts. North American Journal of Fisheries Management 17:726-733. 

This study evaluated the effect of a 3.5 year drawdown of a south 
Carolina reservoir. The drawdown reduced fish abundance, and structure 
and the loss of littoral zone was speculated as driving the changes. The 
system recovered within 9 months of the drawdown to adequate fish 
abundance and species composition but size structure was different. 
Large individuals were rare and the community was dominated by smaller 
individuals. Authors noted the role of refugia in recolonization and 
high reproductive rates of resident fish. Suggests that some reservoir 
communities are resilient to disturbance to physical habitat, thereby 
resembling stream fish communities. 

* Use proportional similarity PS = 1-0.5*sum(abs(p_in-p_ij)) p is the 
proportion of species in site i 
* Reports high level of reproduction post drawdown potentially due to
the inundation of terrestrial plants that had colonized the lake bed.
* Attributed reduction in size structure to mortality of older fish
* Posit that long lived fishes like lmb will take a few years to recover
* Makes a case that stocking post drawdown may not be necessary as communities
are resilient, however it may be required if fish kills occur
